# Contributing to Claude Observe

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo and clone it
2. Run `just install` to install dependencies
3. Run `just dev` to start the dev server
4. Make your changes
5. Run `just test` to make sure tests pass
6. Run `just fmt` to format your code
7. Open a pull request

## Project layout

- `hooks/scripts/` — Hook script and MCP server script
- `hooks/hooks.json` — Plugin hook definitions
- `skills/` — Plugin skills (`/observe`, `/observe stop`, `/observe status`)
- `.claude-plugin/` — Plugin manifest
- `app/server/` — Hono server with SQLite storage and WebSocket
- `app/client/` — React 19 dashboard with shadcn/ui

## Development

- **Server**: `just dev-server` starts with hot reload via tsx
- **Client**: `just dev-client` starts the Vite dev server
- **Both**: `just dev` runs both in parallel

## Code style

- Run `just fmt` before committing (uses Prettier via `.prettierrc`)
- TypeScript throughout — avoid `any` where possible
- Keep the hook script dependency-free (Node.js built-ins only)

## Reporting issues

Open an issue on GitHub with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your environment (OS, Node version, Claude Code version)
