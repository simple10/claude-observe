Agents Observe dashboard and server management.

## Usage

- `/observe` — Open the dashboard URL
- `/observe status` — Show server health and config details
- `/observe start` — Start the server
- `/observe stop` — Stop the server
- `/observe restart` — Restart the server

## Instructions

Parse the user's arguments to determine the subcommand. If no arguments, default to showing the dashboard URL.

### /observe (no args)

1. Run:
   ```bash
   node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/observe_cli.mjs health
   ```
2. If exit code 0: show the dashboard URL from the output.
3. If exit code 1: tell the user the server is not running and suggest `/observe start` or `/observe status`.

### /observe status

1. Run:
   ```bash
   node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/observe_cli.mjs health
   ```
2. Show the full output to the user (includes version, runtime, ports, log paths).
3. If the output contains "Version mismatch", tell the user and offer `/observe restart`.
4. If exit code 1, show the output and suggest `/observe start`.

### /observe start

1. Run:
   ```bash
   node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/observe_cli.mjs start
   ```
2. Show the output to the user. If successful, include the dashboard URL.

### /observe stop

   ```bash
   node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/scripts/observe_cli.mjs stop
