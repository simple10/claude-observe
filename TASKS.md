# TASKS

## QUEUED TASKS

- [ ] Add Result (final message) to Prompt expanded summary event - same as the Stop event

## COMPLETED TASKS

- [x] Add clarifying message to delete confirmation modals (only deletes Observe logs, not Claude session files)
- [x] Improve performance of activity pane and sidebar resizing (direct DOM updates during drag, commit on mouseUp)
- [x] Add Tool:TaskCreate and Tool:TaskUpdate to the Tasks static filter

- [x] Fix Icons modal in Settings - needs to be scrollable
- [x] Add a color wheel picker option to the color pallette
- [x] Sync the agent colors in Activity, agent dropdown, and event stream
- [x] In Activity Timeline:
  - [x] Add new agents directly underneath Main agent
  - [x] Make agent name clickable: scroll down to first agent event in stream
- [x] Add a concept of "selected" row to the events stream - preserve scroll to selected row when filters change
- [x] Fix the dynamic filter bar logic to include any hook that doesn't match one of the static filters
- [x] Add a settings gear icon in bottom of sidebar: Projects & Icons settings
- [x] Change agent chips to a custom dropdown menu
- [x] Show Agent ID and Agent Name in Tool:Agent expanded summary instead of results JSON
  - Added AgentIdentity component showing assigned name, dimmed raw name if different, and agent ID
  - Applied to SubagentStart, SubagentStop, and Tool:Agent expanded views
- [x] Fix the expand sidebar button overlapping with "Filters:" in collapsed mode
  - Header layout stacks vertically when collapsed, hiding logo/spacer so only the expand button shows
- [x] Add a loader (spinner) to the Logs modal
  - Modal opens immediately with spinner, heavy event list deferred via useTransition
- [x] Preserve filter state per session (in-memory)
  - Map<sessionId, filterState> in Zustand store, saves/restores on session switch, defaults to "All"
- [x] Fix sub-agent naming race condition
  - Root cause: pendingAgentNames keyed by sessionId instead of toolUseId, causing overwrites on concurrent spawns
  - Fixed with toolUseId-keyed map, per-session FIFO queue, and named-agents tracking set
- [x] Add 60m option to Activity Timeline
- [x] Group sidebar sessions by relative date (Today, Yesterday, This Week, Last Week, then by month)
- [x] Add home page at root path showing recent sessions across all projects
  - Full stack: GET /sessions/recent API endpoint, React Query hook, HomePage component
- [x] Switch from emojis to lucide-react icons with color coding by event category
  - 32 icon mappings, color-coded: tools=blue, user=green, session=yellow, agents=purple, etc.
  - Timeline dots use solid colored circles with white icon lines
- [x] Improve light mode color contrast
  - Adjusted CSS variables and 12 component files, all using dark: prefix to preserve dark mode
- [x] Add the corresponding Tool: Agent to the stream when filtering by agent chip
- [x] Debug why filter buttons are super lagging in some cases (2215ms → 500ms)
  - Root cause: 700+ EventRow components re-rendered on every filter toggle
  - Fix: React.memo on EventRow, useDeferredValue for filter state, removed allEvents prop
  - Also: pre-built lookup map for filter matching (O(1) vs O(n) per event)
- [x] Add Events status bar above the events stream
- [x] Add a "Filters:" label before the static filters - similar to "Agents:" and "Activity:" labels
- [x] Add Tool "Agent" to the Agents static filter - i.e. shows SubAgentStart/Stop and Tool -> Agent so we can see how the agent was started
- [x] If possible (easy?) add a highlight border color to static filters that match any of the events
- [x] Show number of matching events in small font in agent chip
- [x] Add a Logs button to top right
- [x] Add summary & expanded summary for all 25 hooks in the UI
- [x] Update the dynamic filter bar (row 2) when an agent is selected
- [x] Create a new file that maps hook names to filters, e.g.:
- [x] In the filter bar, split the filters into two rows (static & dynamic)
- [x] Add support for selecting multiple filters
- [x] Make agent chips clickable to filter by agent

- [x] Auto scroll to bottom on session select
- [x] Add bottom padding to event stream
- [x] Chat thread deduping (Pre/PostToolUse merged client-side)
- [x] Stop event shows user prompt above Final message
- [x] SubAgentStop expanded summary with Agent command and results
- [x] Replace CLAUDE_OBSERVE_PORT with CLAUDE_OBSERVE_EVENTS_ENDPOINT

## FUTURE TASKS

Don't implement these yet. They're here for future reference.

- [ ] Track token & context window usage per session and agent
  - On Stop hook, use two-way pattern: hook reads transcript JSONL, sums `usage` fields from all assistant messages, posts totals to `/api/sessions/:id/usage` callback
  - Subagent usage already available in PostToolUse:Agent `tool_response` (totalTokens, totalDurationMs, usage breakdown) — just need to surface in UI
  - Store session-level totals: total input/output tokens, cache read/creation, total duration
  - Show in sidebar (per session) and scope bar (per agent)
  - New `getSessionUsage` command for the two-way hook pattern
